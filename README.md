# Python Package installation - pip install and uv <!-- omit in toc -->

## Objective

This repository provides, under the [Test Virtual Environments](./Test_Virtual_Environments/) folder, two scripts containing commands to create a virtual environment and install Python packages listed in a requirements.txt file.

The difference between the two methods are that one uses traditional pip install, whereas the other uses a Rust package called uv, which is claimed to be faster.

The shell scripts, containing calls to Python, are self-explanatory.  Feel free to edit the requirements.txt when carrying out your tests.
